# RC Car with Wireless Joystick Control (In Progress)

This project will demonstrate a wirelessly controlled RC car using two Raspberry Pi Picos and 2.4GHz radio communication. The goal is to create a simple, modular, and lightweight car that receives commands from a remote joystick module and moves accordingly. While hardware assembly is still in progress, all components have been researched, and the system diagram has been drafted.

## Project Overview

The system is made up of two main units:

### 1. RC Car (Receiver Unit)
The receiver side will be mounted onto the chassis of the RC car. It will include:
- A Raspberry Pi Pico to interpret joystick data
- An nRF24L01+ breakout module to receive data via 2.4GHz
- Two DRV8833 motor drivers to independently control the left and right side wheels
- Four TT gear motors for movement
- Two 5V buck converters to step down from a 2S LiPo (7.4V) battery:
  - One for powering the Pico
  - One for powering the motor drivers

### 2. Joystick Module (Transmitter Unit)
The joystick module will be held separately by the user. It will include:
- A second Raspberry Pi Pico to read analog values from the joystick
- An nRF24L01+ breakout module to transmit the joystick data wirelessly
- A joystick module with X/Y axes and a button
- A dedicated 2S Lipo battery stepped down to 5V using a buck converter

Joystick input will be read by the transmitter Pico, sent over the air using the nRF24L01+ module, and received by the Pico on the car. Based on the values received, the carâ€™s Pico will generate PWM signals to the DRV8833 drivers to spin the motors in the correct direction and speed.

## System Diagram

The following diagram outlines the full system, including power flow, communication links, and signal directions:

## Status

Parts have been ordered and are being prepared for initial prototyping. This repository will be updated with wiring details, code, and testing results once assembly begins.

## Goals

- Demonstrate system-level thinking in embedded design
- Build an RC car using simple, low-cost components
- Apply SPI communication and PWM control in a wireless system
- Use clean modular code structure for both transmitter and receiver
